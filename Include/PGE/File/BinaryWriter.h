/// Utility to write binary data to a file.
/// 
/// In order to expand the capabilities of BinaryWriter the generic write method can be partially specialized
/// with the type(s) you wish to support. It's recommended to closely adhere to the specification and do things
/// as they're done in the library. You have access to a `stream` member, to which all your data is to be written. After
/// writing has concluded it is recommended to call the protected `validate` method in order to do proper error handling.
/// Specializations for other types can utilize preexisting specializations (e.g. a Vector2f is written by calling `write<float>` twice).\n
/// It is recommended to also provide a specialization for reading, if one is provided for writing.\n
/// Variation of functionality of existing types can be achieved by providing a thin wrapper around the object you wish to handle differently.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```cpp
/// struct FixedLengthString { const String& str; };
/// template<> void BinaryWriter::write<FixedLengthString>(const FixedLengthString& val) {
///     // Regular String writer uses byteLength() + 1 to include the terminating null byte.
///     stream.write(val.str.cstr(), val.str.byteLength());
///     validate();
/// }
/// // ...
/// myBinaryWriter.write<FixedLengthString>({ "asd" });
/// ```

/// @see #PGE::TextWriter
