/// In order to expand the capabilities of BinaryReader the generic tryRead method can be partially specialized
/// with the type(s) you wish to support. It's recommended to closely adhere to the specification and do things
/// as they're done in the library. You have access to a `stream` member, from which all your data is to be read.\n
/// If the stream turns bad at any point during the reading process (`stream.good()` returns false), the method should return false.
/// Specializations for other types can utilize preexisting specializations (e.g. a Vector2f is read by calling `read<float>` twice).\n
/// It is recommended to also provide a specialization for writing, if one is provided for reading.\n
/// Variation of functionality of existing types can be achieved by providing a thin wrapper around the object you wish to handle differently.
/// (See BinaryReader for an example.)\n
